The multitrack player uses @educandu/multitrack-audio-player which (indirectly) means that we use p-queue, standardized-audio-context, p-timeout, eventemitter3, @babel/runtime, automation-events and tslib.
The above are used under the MIT licence except tslib, which is Zero-Clause BSD.
Also used is FontAwesome 6. It has a licence which can be read at https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/6.x/LICENSE.txt, if you want to do that.
